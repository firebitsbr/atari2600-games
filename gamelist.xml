Home castle gate is now open - why should you have to open your own castle? You can only carry one item like Adventure. The staff also acts as a magnet to attract objects by holding down the button. A new hideous Dragon created by the Evil Magician guards the chalice on Levels 2 and 3. And many more...</desc>

     <desc>The resistance is about to launch a major offensive against the Intergalactic Empire. In preparation for this, they have captured several battle-grade starships, but they lack the essential power sources for these formidable craft; Klystron Pods. You have been commissioned by the resistance to steal these pods from the Empire's storage planets. Each planet is defended by a battery of "Limpet" guns, powered by a nuclear power plant. By firing shots at the power plant, the guns can be temporarily disabled; the more shots fired at the nuclear reactor, the longer the guns will take to recharge. BUT BEWARE!! If you fire too many shots at the reactor, it will become critical, giving you just ten seconds to clear the planet before it is destroyed. If you have not already retrieved the pod stored at that planet, then you will have failed the mission. If you have retrieved the pod, and you manage to send the reactor into its critical phase, and leave the planet safely, you will receive a hefty bonus. Further into the Empire's system, you will encounter planets with REVERSE GRAVITY and something even more deadly...</desc>

Roll snowballs by holding down the fire button and letting go to smash them against the iceblocks. Only larger snowballs will break the blocks. But don't get too close; this ice is so cold, you will be frozen solid if you touch it! If this wasn't bad enough, all this activity has awakened the old sentinals. Avoid their eerie mechanical movements by throwing snowballs at them. But be quick about it because they will start rebuilding their fortress with new blocks! If you can save six chicks without getting frozen, you are rewarded with an extra penguin</desc>
